ERRORS (must fix):
  1. Use 'type 1 diabetes' instead of 'Type 1 Diabetes (should be lowercase)'
  2. Invalid value 'TP53' for disease.name. Valid values: ['type 1 diabetes']. Note: MUST be lowercase. Do NOT use 'T1D', 'Type 1 Diabetes', or any other variant.

2. Must end with: WITH collect(DISTINCT ...) AS nodes, collect(DISTINCT ...) AS edges RETURN nodes, edges;
3. Use 'type 1 diabetes' for disease name
4. Use ONLY the property names listed above - they are case-sensitive

Original question: Get all diseases associated with gene TP53

Refinement prompt:
Previous Cypher attempt:
MATCH (g:gene)-[r:effector_gene_of]->(d:disease) WHERE g.name = 'TP53' AND d.name = 'type 1 diabetes' WITH collect(DISTINCT g) AS nodes, collect(DISTINCT r) AS edges RETURN nodes, edges;

Validation feedback:
Validation Score: 65/100

ERRORS (must fix):
  1. Use 'type 1 diabetes' instead of 'Type 1 Diabetes (should be lowercase)'
  2. Invalid value 'TP53' for disease.name. Valid values: ['type 1 diabetes']. Note: MUST be lowercase. Do NOT use 'T1D', 'Type 1 Diabetes', or any other variant.

PASSED CHECKS:
  ✓ WITH clause properly structured with collect()
  ✓ All relationships have variable names
  ✓ Correct return format with nodes and edges
  ✓ All collect() use DISTINCT
  ✓ All collected variables are defined in MATCH
  ✓ Query has appropriate WHERE constraints
  ✓ All properties appear valid
  ✓ All relationships have correct source/target node types

Detailed Properties for Query Entities:

Node Properties:

  disease:
    - id (String)
    - name (String)
      Valid values: ['type 1 diabetes']
      Note: MUST be lowercase. Do NOT use 'T1D', 'Type 1 Diabetes', or any other variant.

  gene:
    - id (String)
    - id_version (Int)
    - description (String)
    - count (Int)
    - chr (String)

Relationship Properties:

  effector_gene_of (gene→disease):
    - evidence (String)
    - effector_gene_list_url (String)
    - data_version (String)
    - data_source_url (String)
    - data_source (String)

Please fix the issues and regenerate the Cypher query.
Remember:
1. Every relationship needs a variable name like [r:type] not [:type]
2. Must end with: WITH collect(DISTINCT ...) AS nodes, collect(DISTINCT ...) AS edges RETURN nodes, edges;
3. Use 'type 1 diabetes' for disease name
4. Use ONLY the property names listed above - they are case-sensitive
